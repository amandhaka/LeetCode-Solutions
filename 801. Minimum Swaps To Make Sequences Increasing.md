We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
Note:

A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].

Approach:
```
I will be explaining the approach here.

swap[i] = total no. of swaps required to keep array from 0 to i in increasing order when we swap the ith positions
notswap[i] = total no. of swaps required to keep array from 0 to i in increasing order when we do not swap the ith positions
If condition ( A [ i ] > A [ i - 1] & & B [ i ]> B [ i - 1 ] ) is satisfied then

if we swap ith and we have to swap i-1 th also.
if we do not swap ith and we can not swap i-1 th also.
If condition ( A [ i ] > B [ i - 1 ] && B [ i ]> A [ i - 1 ] ) is satisfied then

if we swap ith then we can not swap i-1 th.
if we do not swap ith then we have to swap i-1 th.
The two conditions can be met simuntaneously for a given i.
( It is not a if and else ) that is why in second if we have min to keep the minimum obtained for swap[i] and notswap[i] on following these two conditions.

So the thought process is like :

CONDITION1 is true okay
CONDITION2 is also true oh then I should keep the minimum.
(And if only CONDITION2 is true then the minimum will from CONDITION2 because: swap[i]=n; notswap[i]=n; are the max values )

If we'll use if else then we won't be able to get the minimum from both the conditions.
If it is not clear now also.Do comment I'll try my best to help!

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwap(int[] A, int[] B) {
        int[] swap=new int[A.length];
        int[] noSwap=new int[B.length];
        swap[0]=1;
        noSwap[0]=0;
        for(int i=1;i<A.length;i++){
            swap[i]=A.length;
            noSwap[i]=B.length;
            if(A[i-1]<A[i] && B[i-1]<B[i]){
                swap[i]=swap[i-1]+1; //If we swap ith then we need to swap i-1 th too.
                noSwap[i]=noSwap[i-1];
            }
            //this if is for condition where we only need to swap ith becuase i-1 th digits will be alright
            if(A[i-1]<B[i] && A[i]>B[i-1]){
                swap[i]=Math.min(noSwap[i-1]+1,swap[i]);
                noSwap[i]=Math.min(swap[i-1],noSwap[i]);
            }
        }
        return Math.min(swap[A.length-1],noSwap[A.length-1]);
    }
}
```
