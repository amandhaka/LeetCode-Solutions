Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```
Note:
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

```java
/*
This is a nice problem.
Intuition:
1. All numbers are occuring twice except one.
2. XOR of all numbers will result in XOR of two numbers which are occuring once.
3. So now we have to divide the nums in two array so that in one set we will have the first element and in second set we will have other element.
4.How are we gonna do it? So we know that xor gives us 1 at a bit place if the bits of both number is different. 
5. So our xor can't be 0 because then the number won't be different. So we will have '1' atleast at one place .
6. So we will find the least significant bit of xor as we know that that is the bit where those two number differ. or where one of the number's bit is 1 and other's is 0.
7. Then we will do xor of allthe bits with 0 as LSB and xor of all the bits with 1 as LSB .
8. After this xor on each group will give us the element in particular group;

       // System.out.println(k);
        int[] ans=new int[2];
        k=1<<k;

            if((nums[i]&k)==0){
                //all the numbers with LSB as 0
                ans[0]^=nums[i];
            }else{
                ans[1]^=nums[i];
            }
