A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Example 1:

Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
Example 2:

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
Example 3:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2

```java

class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length<2) return nums.length;
        int sign=nums[1]-nums[0];
        int res=sign!=0?2:1;
        for(int i=2;i<nums.length;i++){
            int diff=nums[i]-nums[i-1];
            if(diff<0 && sign>=0){ // we saw a negative differnce add it to count and change the sign. Now only increase when we see a positive difference
                sign=diff;
                res++;
            } else if(diff>0 && sign<=0){
                sign=diff;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
/*
    Another way to put it is to count all changes of direction (all peaks and valleys) and return that count +1:
