Given an array of integers A, find the sum of min(B), where B ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of A.

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: 17
Explanation: Subarrays are [3], [1], [2], [4], [3,1], [1,2], [2,4], [3,1,2], [1,2,4], [3,1,2,4]. 
Minimums are 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1.  Sum is 17.
```

Note:
```
1 <= A.length <= 30000
1 <= A[i] <= 30000
```
## EXPLANTION
```cpp
Before diving into the solution, we first introduce a very important stack type, which is called monotone stack .

What is monotonous increase stack?
Roughly speaking, the elements in the an monotonous increase stack keeps an increasing order.

The typical paradigm for monotonous increase stack:
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  while(!in_stk.empty() && in_stk.top() > A[i]){
    in_stk.pop();
  }
  in_stk.push(A[i]);
}
What can monotonous increase stack do?
(1) find the previous less element of each element in a vector with O(n) time:
What is the previous less element of an element?
For example:
[3, 7, 8, 4]
The previous less element of 7 is 3.
The previous less element of 8 is 7.
The previous less element of 4 is 3.
There is no previous less element for 3.
For simplicity of notation, we use abbreviation PLE to denote Previous Less Element.

C++ code (by slitghly modifying the paradigm):
Instead of directly pushing the element itself, here for simplicity, we push the index.
We do some record when the index is pushed into the stack.
// previous_less[i] = j means A[j] is the previous less element of A[i].
// previous_less[i] = -1 means there is no previous less element of A[i].
vector<int> previous_less(A.size(), -1);
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  while(!in_stk.empty() && A[in_stk.top()] > A[i]){
    in_stk.pop();
  }
  previous_less[i] = in_stk.empty()? -1: in_stk.top();
  in_stk.push(i);
}
(2) find the next less element of each element in a vector with O(n) time:
What is the next less element of an element?
For example:
[3, 7, 8, 4]
The next less element of 8 is 4.
The next less element of 7 is 4.
There is no next less element for 3 and 4.
For simplicity of notation, we use abbreviation NLE to denote Next Less Element.

C++ code (by slighly modifying the paradigm):
We do some record when the index is poped out from the stack.
// next_less[i] = j means A[j] is the next less element of A[i].
// next_less[i] = -1 means there is no next less element of A[i].
vector<int> previous_less(A.size(), -1);
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  while(!in_stk.empty() && A[in_stk.top()] > A[i]){
    auto x = in_stk.top(); in_stk.pop();
    next_less[x] = i;
  }
  in_stk.push(i);
}
How can the monotonous increase stack be applied to this problem?
For example:
Consider the element 3 in the following vector:

                            [2, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 6, 1]
			     |                    |
	             the previous less       the next less 
	                element of 3          element of 3

After finding both NLE and PLE of 3, we can determine the
distance between 3 and 2(previous less) , and the distance between 3 and 1(next less).
In this example, the distance is 4 and 3 respectively.

How many subarrays with 3 being its minimum value?
The answer is 4*3.

9 7 8 3 
9 7 8 3 4 
9 7 8 3 4 6 
7 8 3 
7 8 3 4 
7 8 3 4 6 
8 3 
8 3 4 
8 3 4 6 
3 
3 4 
3 4 6
How much the element 3 contributes to the final answer?
It is 3*(4*3).
What is the final answer?
Denote by left[i] the distance between element A[i] and its PLE.
Denote by right[i] the distance between element A[i] and its NLE.

The final answer is,
sum(A[i]*left[i]*right[i] )
```
## WHY MULTIPLCATION GIVE US SUBARRAYS ##
```
This is impossible to derive in interview. An easier way of looking at it is this:

The number of subarrays with 3 in it will be anything that starts in [L..3] and ends in [3..R]. So we have [L..3] starting positions and [3..R] ending positions. In other words, we have d1 starting positions and d2 ending positions. So the total number of subarrays is just d1*d2.

For example:
in [9,7,8,3,4,6]
we have 4 choices to start with (9,7,8,3)
we have 3 choices to end with (3,4,6)

So answer is just 4*3.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumSubarrayMins(int[] A) {
        int n=A.length;
        int mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
        int[] left=new int[n],right=new int[n];
        Stack<int[]> stack1=new Stack<>(),stack2=new Stack<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int count=1;
            while(!stack1.isEmpty() && stack1.peek()[0]>A[i]){
                count+=stack1.pop()[1];
            }
            stack1.push(new int[]{A[i],count});
            left[i]=count;
        }
        for(int j=n-1;j>=0;j--){
            int count=1;
            while(!stack2.isEmpty() && stack2.peek()[0]>=A[j]){
                count+=stack2.pop()[1];
            }
            stack2.push(new int[]{A[j],count});
            right[j]=count;
        }
        int res=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            res=(res+A[i]*left[i]*right[i])%mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
