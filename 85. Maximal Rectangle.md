Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

```java
/*
This is a follow up of Max area under histogram . See it like that only. lets say if you a matrix like
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1

Then consider it has histrogram
   __4_
2  | |
___| |
| |  |
| |  | and sooo on. Then use the the technique which is used in histogram.
There it was only one array so Each time consider the whole row as an array 
and keep adding the previous row elements in current row . Let say if you have previous
0 1 1 1 0 
then present row is 0 1 0 1 0
then current will be 0 2 0 2 0 ..  The second index became zero as it can't be used as an rectanlg as we have 0 there.
