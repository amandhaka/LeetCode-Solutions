Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

Note:
```
You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
```
```java

class Solution {
    class Sort implements Comparator<int[]>{
        public int compare(int[]a,int[]b){
            return a[0]-b[0]!=0?a[0]-b[0]:a[1]-b[1];
        }
    }
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if(intervals.length<=1) return 0;
        
        Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(intervals),new Sort());
        int del=0;
        int[] curr=intervals[0];
        for(int i=1;i<intervals.length;i++){
            int x1=curr[0];
            int y1=curr[1];
            int x2=intervals[i][0];
            int y2=intervals[i][1];
            if(x2<y1){
                del++;
                curr[1]=Math.min(intervals[i][1],curr[1]);
            } else{
                curr=intervals[i];
            }
        }
        return del;
    }
}

//[[1,100],[1,11],[2,12],[11,22]]

```
