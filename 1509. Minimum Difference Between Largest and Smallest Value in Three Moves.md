Given an array nums, you are allowed to choose one element of nums and change it by any value in one move.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after perfoming at most 3 moves.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]
Output: 2
```
Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,6,14,15]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```
```java
/*
There are only four possible move 
delete 3 largest
delete  2 largest 1 smallest
delete 2 smallest 1 largest
delete 3 smallet
if we have 0 1 1 4 4 6 6
we can make last 3 elements as '4'
also we can make first element as 1 and last two as 4
and so on.
*/
class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length<5) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int n=nums.length;
        for(int i=0;i<4;i++){ // because only four operations are possible
            res=Math.min(res,nums[n-4+i]-nums[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
