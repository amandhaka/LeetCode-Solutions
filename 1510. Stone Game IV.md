Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n. Return True if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return False, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
```
Example 4:
```
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
```
Example 5:
```
Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.

/*
This is a classic dp problem so here A person can win if he is on perfect square say 1,4,9,16
or he can make the other person lose such that he subtracts such perfect square from the current number that after subtracting it the other player would not land on perfect square. Lets take an example
lets say n=7
so we are marking ith element is true if alice can win on that and if she can't then thats false.
Lets say n=4 so that will give true as alice can subtract 4 in the first chance. But when n = 7
Then lets if alice subtract 1 then bob will be on 6 and whoever is on 6 will win as show in dp array below. As you can sub 4 from it which will result in 2 and then alice will have to remove one from it and then bob will remove one and make it zero.

class Solution {
    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp=new boolean[n+1];
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int k=i;k*k<=n;k++){
                //!dp[i-k*k] because if we are on ith number and subtract k*k as we can only subtract perfect square so if that is false that means whoever lands on i-k*k will lose so I can make ith number true. And if dp[i-k*k] is true that means i can't subtract k*k as it will result in other person win . So i will move to next perfect square
                if(!dp[i-k*k]){
                    dp[i]=true;
                    break;
                }
            }
