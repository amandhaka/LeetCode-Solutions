There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. Each course has some duration(course length) t and closed on dth day. A course should be taken continuously for t days and must be finished before or on the dth day. You will start at the 1st day.

Given n online courses represented by pairs (t,d), your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.

Example:
```
Input: [[100, 200], [200, 1300], [1000, 1250], [2000, 3200]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There're totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.
```

Note:
```
The integer 1 <= d, t, n <= 10,000.
You can't take two courses simultaneously.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {
        int n = courses.length;
        Arrays.sort(courses,(a,b)->a[1]-b[1]);
        /*
        Priority Queue will maintain the durations of course taken lets say we have taken course with duration 100 and 600 and now we encounter a course which should be finished under 500 and having duration of 100 only then we should delete the course with 600 because that's taking too much time and if we include current course which  is 100 in duration then we will be able to add more courses in future that will save time
        */
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq=new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->b-a);
        int time=0;
        for(int i=0;i<courses.length;i++){
            if(time+courses[i][0]<=courses[i][1]){
                pq.add(courses[i][0]);
                time+=courses[i][0];
            } else{
                if(!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek()>courses[i][0]){
                    int tempCourse=pq.peek();
                    pq.poll();
                    pq.offer(courses[i][0]);
                    time+=courses[i][0]-tempCourse;
                }
            }
        }
        return pq.size();
    }
}
