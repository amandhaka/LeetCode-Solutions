Given an array of integers arr and an integer target.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-a\rray of sum = 6.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: arr = [5,5,4,4,5], target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot find a sub-array of sum = 3.
```
Example 5:
```
Input: arr = [3,1,1,1,5,1,2,1], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Note that sub-arrays [1,2] and [2,1] cannot be an answer because they overlap.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {
        Map<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        int sum=0;
        map.put(0,-1);
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            sum+=arr[i];
            map.put(sum,i);
        }
        int lsize=Integer.MAX_VALUE; // to keep track of size of subarray in left side of array
        sum=0;
        int result=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            sum+=arr[i];
            if(map.get(sum-target)!=null){ //this will check if we havve subarray sum equal target before this element
                lsize=Math.min(lsize,i-map.get(sum-target));
            }
            if(map.get(sum+target)!=null && lsize<Integer.MAX_VALUE){ //this will check if we have subarray sum ewual to target after
                result=Math.min(result,map.get(sum+target)-i+lsize);
            }
        }
        return result==Integer.MAX_VALUE?-1:result;
    }
}
```
