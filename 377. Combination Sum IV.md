Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
 

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?


```java

class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        int[] dp=new int[target+1];
        dp[0]=1;
        /*
        This is similar to coin change 2 problem but here order of numbers in solution matter as 112 is not same as 121
        So for that we need to change the order or inner loop and outer loop. For example we have target = 5 and 
        nums=2,3 so we subtract 5-2 and look at dp[3] and add it to current position in dp and then we subtract 5-3 and 
        look at dp[2] and add it . Basically means if we already have 2 then we need 3 to add dp[3] and vice versa
        And in Coin change problem we solve the question like if i use 2 how many numbers of amount I can form So when I 
        reach at position 5 i ll look at dp[5-2]= dp[3] and dp[3] will have 0 at that time.
        */
        for(int i=1;i<=target;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<nums.length;j++){
                if(nums[j]>i){
                    continue;
                }
                dp[i]+=dp[i-nums[j]];
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}

```
