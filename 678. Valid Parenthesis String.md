Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
An empty string is also valid.
Example 1:
Input: "()"
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: "(*)"
Output: True
Example 3:
Input: "(*))"
Output: True
Note:
The string size will be in the range [1, 100].

```java
/*
What we are doing here is Just consider there is a line and for first loop we consider every * as ( so whenver we go below the line that means balance become <0 then we know even with considering * we don't have enough open brackets so we return false and same goes with second loop but here we consider every * as ). 
DOUBT: the string needs to be balanced so say we have ((((()) here our balance doesn't go below 0 so we don't return false but in second loop it will go below zero.
*/
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        int balance=0;
        for(char ch:s.toCharArray()){
            if(ch=='(' || ch=='*') balance++;
            else balance--;
            if(balance<0) return false;
        }
        balance=0;
        for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--) {
            char ch=s.charAt(i);
            if(ch==')' || ch=='*') balance++;
            else balance--;
            if(balance<0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
