Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
Output: 1 
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
Output: 0
```

```java
/*
Intuition : if we have number [1,2,3] then we can make [1,5) from numbers and not 6. So next missing number is 7 and so we add 7 to array and now we can make 1-13 sum from array and next missing is 14. And so on.
*/
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        int patch=0;
        long miss=1; //because without looking at any number you can make 0 sum so you are missing 1. So missing is 1.
        int i=0;
        while(miss<=n){ //If we 
            if(i<nums.length && nums[i]<=miss){
                miss+=nums[i++];
            } else{
                miss+=miss;
                patch++;
            }
        }
        return patch;
    }
}


```


Explantion:
```
Without looking at any numbers, you have the range [0,1). That is, you can build only the sum 0. Then you see a 1, which you can add to 0 to get sum 1, so now you have the range [0,2). Then you see 2, which you can add to 0 or to 1, giving you 2 or 3, so now you have range [0,4). Then you see 4, which you can add to sums 0, 1, 2 or 3, to get range [0, 8).
```
