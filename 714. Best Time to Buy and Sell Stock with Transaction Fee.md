Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.
```
Example 1:
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```
Approach
```
Only 1 share of the stock can be bought or sold;
A stock can be bought or sold for multiple times in one day, but it has to be sold before being bought again;
The service fee is only charged when stock is sold;
Cash(i): the cash in hand, if you are not holding the stock at the end of day(i):
You might be not holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), and do nothing in day(i): a = cash(i-1); or
You might be holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), and sell it at the end of day(i):
b = hold(i-1) + prices[i] - fee;
Choose the greatest one as the value of cash(i) to get the greater potential profit:
cash(i) = max(a, b) = max(cash(i-1), hold(i-1) + prices[i] - fee);
Hold(i): the cash in hand, if you are holding the stock at the end of day(i):
You might be holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), and do nothing in day(i): a = hold(i-1); or
You might be not holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), and buy it at the end of day(i): b = cash(i-1) - prices[i]; or
You might be holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), sell it on day(i), and buy it again at the end of day(i):
c = (hold(i-1) + prices[i] - fee) - prices[i];
Choose the greatest one as the value of hold(i) to get the greater potential profit:
hold(i) = max(a,b,c)
Because max(b, c) = max(cash(i-1), hold(i-1) + prices[i] - fee) - prices[i] = cash(i) - prices[i],
so hold(i) = max(hold(i-1), cash(i) - prices[i]);
There is another way to calculate hold(i), which is more straight forward:
You might be holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), and do nothing in day(i): a = hold(i-1); or
You might be not holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), and buy it at the end of day(i): b = cash(i-1) - prices[i]; or
You might be holding the stock at the end of day(i-1), sell it on day(i), and buy it again at the end of day(i):
c = (hold(i-1) + prices[i] - fee) - prices[i] = hold(i-1) - fee;
Obviously, a > c, so max(a, c) = a, hold(i) = max(a, b, c) = max(a, b) = max(hold(i-1), cash(i-1) - prices[i])
The target is to find the maximum profit at the end of day(N): cash(N);

```java

/*
Hold- The amount we are having with one stock bought.
Cash- The amount of final cash after each transaction.
We make the following decision: 
1- we don't sell the stock today and keep the cash as it is.
2- we sell the stock and buy on same day
3- we sell the stock and don't buy
*/
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int cash=0,hold=-prices[0]; // -prices[0] will not cause problem . Lets say we have 7 1 2 so It seems like we are holding -7 and that will give us less profit in future. But it is not like that. We are calculating cash on every step so that if cash is less than 0 then in hold we will subtract cash-prices[i] so what will make our new hold price
        
        for(int i=1;i<prices.length;i++){
            cash=Math.max(cash,hold+prices[i]-fee);//we don't sell it today or we sell it today
            hold=Math.max(hold,cash-prices[i]);//we don't buy today. or we buy today
        }
        return cash;
    }
}
