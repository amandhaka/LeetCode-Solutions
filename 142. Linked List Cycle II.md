Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
Note: Do not modify the linked list.
Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```
Follow-up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }

suppose you have travel N nodes with slow then 2N with fast pointer. D is the distance between head and start of loop/cycle which we have to find and K is the distance from start of loop to node where slow and fast meet and Ci is the distance traveled in loop in i iteration by slow and cj for fast pointer.

N=D+k+ci
2N=D+k+cj
putting N value in 2 equ
2(D+k+ci)=D+k+cj
2D+2k+2ci=D+k+cj
D+k=c(j-2i)C
k=c(j-2i)C-D

So if we start from head to K(where they meet) we have to travel D distance and if we are D nodes behind K so we move D nodes from point where we met to reach the starting of loop
