The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1
```
Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

Explanation

At first glance, the problem exhibits the feature of "optimal substructure": if we want to rob maximum amount of money from current binary tree (rooted at root), we surely hope that we can do the same to its left and right subtrees.

So going along this line, let's define the function rob(root) which will return the maximum amount of money that we can rob for the binary tree rooted at root; the key now is to construct the solution to the original problem from solutions to its subproblems, i.e., how to get rob(root) from rob(root.left), rob(root.right), ... etc.

Apparently the analyses above suggest a recursive solution. And for recursion, it's always worthwhile figuring out the following two properties:

Termination condition: when do we know the answer to rob(root) without any calculation? Of course when the tree is empty ---- we've got nothing to rob so the amount of money is zero.

Recurrence relation: i.e., how to get rob(root) from rob(root.left), rob(root.right), ... etc. From the point of view of the tree root, there are only two scenarios at the end:
root is robbed or is not. If it is, due to the constraint that "we cannot rob any two directly-linked houses", the next level of subtrees that are available would be the four "grandchild-subtrees" (root.left.left, root.left.right, root.right.left, root.right.right). However if root is not robbed, 
the next level of available subtrees would just be the two "child-subtrees" (root.left, root.right). We only need to choose the scenario which yields the larger amount of money.

In step I, we only considered the aspect of "optimal substructure", but think little about the possibilities of overlapping of the subproblems. For example, to obtain rob(root), we need rob(root.left), rob(root.right), rob(root.left.left), rob(root.left.right), rob(root.right.left), rob(root.right.right); but to get rob(root.left), we also need rob(root.left.left), rob(root.left.right), similarly for rob(root.right). The naive solution above computed these subproblems repeatedly, which resulted in bad time performance. Now if you recall the two conditions for dynamic programming (DP): "optimal
substructure" + "overlapping of subproblems", we actually have a DP problem. A naive way to implement DP here is to use a hash map to record the results for visited subtrees.
