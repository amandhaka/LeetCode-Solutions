of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

Example:
```
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

Return 4.
```

```java

class Solution {
    private static int[][] dirs={{0,1},{1,0},{-1,0},{0,-1}};
    public int trapRainWater(int[][] heightMap) {
        int m=heightMap.length;
        int n=heightMap[0].length;
        int rain=0;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq=new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->a[2]-b[2]);
        boolean[][] visited=new boolean[m][n];
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            visited[i][0]=true;
            visited[i][n-1]=true;
            pq.offer(new int[]{i,0,heightMap[i][0]});
            pq.offer(new int[]{i,n-1,heightMap[i][n-1]});
        }
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
            visited[0][j]=true;
            visited[m-1][j]=true;
            pq.offer(new int[]{0,j,heightMap[0][j]});
            pq.offer(new int[]{m-1,j,heightMap[m-1][j]});
        }
        while(!pq.isEmpty()){
            int[] curr=pq.poll();
            int row=curr[0];
            int col=curr[1];
            int h=curr[2];
            for(int[] dir:dirs){
                int r=row+dir[0];
                int c=col+dir[1];
                /*so we are taking the minimum on the edges and see if any of its neighbor has smaller wall than it
                Question arises is if we have one edge 5 and its neighbor is 3 so we can fill here but what if there
                is a 2 which is neighbor of 3 . 
                6 6 6
                2 3 5
                6 6 9
                so here if we have 5 then we know it's neighbor is 3 and we can fill here but there is a 2 which is 
                is lower than 3 so we can't . But on thing to notice here is we are using priority queue so it will 
                take the lowest first so 2 will be taken first and 3 will be marked visited at that time only.
                So even if we have a long array like 2 4 5 6 7 9 then we know if we are at 9 then we have already 
                visited its neighbor because 2 4 5 6 are lower than 9
                */
                if(r>0 && r<m-1  && c<n-1 && c>0 && !visited[r][c]){
                    visited[r][c]=true;
                    rain+=Math.max(0,h-heightMap[r][c]);
                    pq.offer(new int[]{r,c,Math.max(h,heightMap[r][c])});
                }
            }
        }
        return rain;
    }
}
