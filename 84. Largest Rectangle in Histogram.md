Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

 

Example:
```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```
```java
/*
Main intuition here is :
SO we are using stack here or to be specific montone stack to keep increasing order . So why do we need stack. we need to store only the elements in stack so that out rectange 
is not breaking lets say we have 1 2 3 1 4 So if we have bar of 1 thats good then we have bar of two thats also good as 1 is less than 2 and we can use 2's part in 1 to 
calculate rectange area then we have 3 so still our rectangle is fine with 1 and 2 . but now we have 1 so we can't expand our rectangle. Main thing here is while calculating 
area for a particular histogram we need to think that as smallest in height and see how many bars on left and on right can be included in the area of ith bar . so only the bars
which are greater or equal than current bar can be included so  we are keeping track of elements that are smaller than particular element so we won't be able to include them 
and whn we encounter smller on right we know this rectangle can't go anyfurthur so we calculate area for that and pop it off then we check for the next on stack top with
current if thats also small then also area can't be expanded so we calculate and pop it off . for example we have 1 5 6 in stack and now encounter 2 so we can't expand 6 
rectangle area furthur so we calculate for that and pop it of then we have 5 so now we know that betweeen 5 and 2 their is a gap and we know the bar which was there must be 
of greater height as we are maintaining increasing order of height so our height is 5 as we consider height as min always and we know elements before 5 are smaler so we can't
include that so we take width as 2. one for 5 and one for gap and height as 5 so area is 5*2=10

    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {

        int i=0;
        stack.push(-1);
        for(i=0;i<heights.length;i++){
            while(stack.peek()!=-1 && heights[stack.peek()]>heights[i]){
                area=Math.max(area,heights[stack.pop()]*(i-stack.peek()-1));
            }
            stack.push(i);
