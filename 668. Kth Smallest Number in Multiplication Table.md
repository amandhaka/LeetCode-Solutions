Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 
Explanation: 
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9

The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
Example 2:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 
Explanation: 
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6

The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
Note:
The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
The k will be in the range [1, m * n]


```java

So how does binary search applies here. We have a lower bound and we have a uppper bound and we need to find an element betweeen them. We will take the mid element and then check if its enough or not . Enough function is to check if we have atleast k elements smaller than k . So until we reach the the mid where exactly k elements are  smaller than it our binary search continues.
So the only confusing line in this code is cnt+=Math.min(n,mid/i); 
where count gives us the elements smaller than mid. 
iF we take an element and divide it by the row number then we will the the corresponding row it is in
and if that element is not in that column then we will get the column which holds the number just less than our mid . So that will give us the number of element lesser than mid in that row.
Example. 
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9
suppose our mid is 6 and we divide 6/1 so we get 6 that means 6 elements are smaller than or equal to 6 in first row and in second row we get 6/2=3 so 3 elements are smaller than or equal to 3 and so on.

class Solution {
    public int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int left=1;
        int right=m*n;
        while(left<right){
            int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            if(enough(mid,m,n,k)) right=mid;
            else left=mid+1;
        }
        return left;
    }
    public static boolean enough(int mid,int m, int n, int k){
        int cnt=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
            cnt+=Math.min(n,mid/i);
        }
        return cnt>=k;
    }
}
