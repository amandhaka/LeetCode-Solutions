You have a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of integers (w, h). One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.

What is the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll? (put one inside other)

Note:
Rotation is not allowed.

Example:

Input: [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3 
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).

```java

class Solution {
    class Sort implements Comparator<int[]> {
        public int compare(int[] a,int[]b){
            return a[0]==b[0]?b[1]-a[1]:a[0]-b[0];//because we can't fit 3,3 in 3,4 so if we do 3,4 3,3
            //then in longest increasing subs for 3 wont count 4
        }
    }
    public int maxEnvelopes(int[][] e) {
        if(e.length==0)return 0;
        Arrays.sort(e,new Sort());
        int[] dp=new int[e.length];
        int size=0;
        //we have sorted the array with it's widht now we can find the longest increasing subsequence 
        //by considering height as an array. Using Binary seach method to find longest common subsequecnce
        // in nlogn time
        for(int[] env:e){
            int left=0;
            int right=size;
            while(left<right){
                int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
                if(dp[mid]<env[1]) left=mid+1;
                else right=mid;
            }
            dp[left]=env[1];
            if(left==size){
                size++;
            }
        }
        return size;
    }
}
```
