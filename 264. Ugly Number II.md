Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```
Note:  
```
1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.
```
```java
/*
Approach : So ugly numbers are those numbers which has only 2,3,5 as prime factors. it doesn't mean their all of these should be in the factos but atleast one of them should be there. So we can say that every ugly number will be multiple of either 2 or 3 or 5. Lets take 7 so 7 is not an ugly number because its not an mutliple of 2,3,5 and lets take 10 it is a ugly number as it has 2 and 5 as its factors . SO what will we do is we will maintain an arraylist that will only store the multiples of 2,3,5 in ascending order upto n numbers.
*/
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        if(n<=1) return n;
        ArrayList<Integer> ugly=new ArrayList<>();
        ugly.add(1);
        int a=0,b=0,c=0; //to maintain the last multiple of 2,3,5
        while(ugly.size()<n){
            int nextVal=Math.min(2*ugly.get(a),Math.min(3*ugly.get(b),5*ugly.get(c)));
            ugly.add(nextVal);
            if(nextVal==2*ugly.get(a)) a++;
            if(nextVal==3*ugly.get(b)) b++;
            if(nextVal==5*ugly.get(c)) c++;
        }
        return ugly.get(ugly.size()-1);
    }
}

```
