Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
Example 2:

Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
    
    
    
```java
/*
We will go with this question like this. Lets say we have t=aab and s=abccabcbaac so first take only t=a s=abccabcbaac
and see how many subseq we can form with t=a
  a b c c a b c b a a c
a 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 4 4
So answer is 4 . 
and lets take t=aa 
  '' a b c c a b c b a a c
'' 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
a  0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 4 4
a  0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 6 6

So its like when we encountered the second character of t 'a' equal to any character in s then we see how many subsequences were
there if we remove both of these letters + how many subsequences with the current letter in t because that will give the number of times the current chaaracter in t has encountered.

    public int numDistinct(String s, String t) {
        if(s.equals(t)) return 1;
        int res=0;
        int[][] dp=new int[t.length()+1][s.length()+1];
        for(int i=0;i<dp[0].length;i++){
            dp[0][i]=1;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<dp.length;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<dp[0].length;j++){
                if(t.charAt(i-1)==s.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i][j-1]+dp[i-1][j-1]; //with dp[i-1][j-1] we are looking how many subse we had with one less 
                    //character and with dp[i][j-1] we are looking how many subse with curr character
                } else{
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[t.length()][s.length()];
    }
}
