Given an array, strs, with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s. Also two integers m and n.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are "10","0001","1","0".
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 600
1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
1 <= m, n <= 100


```java

/*
So this is 0/1 knapsack kind of problem. Whenever we are given a problem where we have to take different combinations to compute final result, we use
0/1 knapsack. Like here , We can choose 10 first then 0 and then 1 . Or first 1 and then 0 and then 10. Or just 0 and 1. 
So always use 0/1 knapsack here. 

*/

class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp=new int[m+1][n+1];
        for(String s:strs){
            int zero=countZeroAndOne(s,'0');
            int one=countZeroAndOne(s,'1');
            for(int i=m;i>=zero;i--){
                for(int j=n;j>=one;j--){
                    dp[i][j]=Math.max(dp[i][j],dp[i-zero][j-one]+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
    public static int countZeroAndOne(String s,char zeroOrOne){
        int count=0;
        for(char ch:s.toCharArray()){
            if(ch==zeroOrOne) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
