Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.


```java

class Solution {
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        int[]dp=new int[n+1];
        for(int i=1;i<dp.length;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<i;j++){
                /*
                This checks for only two numbers like for 4 it will check (1,3)(2,2)(3,1)
                */
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i],(i-j)*j); 
                
                /*
                The below statments deals with multiple number for example for 10 . If we just have the above statement
                only (1,9)(2,8)(3,7)(4,6) pairs will be checked. But in the statement below we have dp[j] which is
                basically checking if I subtract 4 from ten the dp[4] will tell me the maximum multple I can get for 
                breaking 4. For example if j=7 then. 10-7 * dp[7] where dp[7] will have 3*4 so 3*4*3 is maximum.
                */
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i],dp[j]*(i-j));
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
/*
0 1 2 3 4
0 0 1 2 4 
*/
```
